# Data Analysis Portfolio
This is a portfolio consisting of numerous projects performed using a variety of tools - Python, Microsoft Excel,
SQL and Power BI.

### Project 1 - Analysing the Down Jones Industrial Average Index (US30)
•	Analysed historical stock market data of NASDAQ 100 and Dow Jones 30 using Python.

•	Conducted exploratory data analysis, identifying missing values, and outliers in key features.

•	Applied data transformation techniques to determine high volatility days, trend durations, and 
      conditional probabilities.

•	Visualized insights through various plots, including volatility comparison, conditional probability donut 
      chart, and trend length histograms.

•	Calculated and presented key findings, including most volatile days, average trend durations, and 
      conditional probabilities for trend continuation and day closing probabilities.

### Project 2 - Descriptive Analysis of the Applications for Home Loans
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA on "ApplicationTrain" dataset using SQL queries, 
      identifying null values and outliers for comprehensive data assessment.
      
•	Demographic Insights: Extracted and presented gender distribution, average children per client, and 
      income distribution through SQL calculations, providing key demographic insights.
      
•	Income Analysis: Analysed income patterns by categorizing clients into income classes, determining 
      highest average income by gender, occupation, and organization type.
      
•	Occupation Insights: Investigated occupation-related trends, including distribution, average children, 
      and upper-income clientele percentage per occupation type, utilizing SQL analysis.
      
### Project 3 - Retail Sales Dashboard in Power BI
•     Data Cleaning - Removed duplicates and blank cells, if any. Formatted columns to the appropriate data type.  

•     Data Connection - Connected the Excel Workbook to Microsoft Power BI, allowing changes in the workbook to
      reflect in the dashboard.
      
•     Data Transformation - Created a few pivot tables in Microsoft Excel from the sales dataset.

•     Data Visualisation - Created an interactive sales dashboard showing insight into the data such as trends in sales
      as well as the relevant KPIs for a retail sales store.

### Project 4 - Strategic Dashboard in Excel
•     Key Performance Indicators: Displayed a number of KPIs and metrics including Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Revenue Per Order and Average Quantity Per Order.

•     Data Visualisations: Included a number of bar charts illustrating the top 10 countries and genres that generate the highest revenues.

•     Trend Analysis: Displayed how the company's revenue has changed over the 5 years with the use of a line chart.

•     Customer Segmentation: Identified and displayed the percentages of customers who are employed and unemployed. The top 5 highest spending customers were also displayed.

### Project 5 - Application of Machine Learning in Credit Risk Default 
•     Machine Learning Model Development: Developed and implemented machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers, for a credit           risk assessment project.

•     Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including feature binning, one-hot encoding, and binary label encoding, enhancing data           quality for model training.

•     Model Evaluation and Selection: Evaluated model performance and selected the Random Forest Classifier as the optimal model, achieving an accuracy of 82.38% on a test dataset.

•     Continuous Improvement: Demonstrated a commitment to model refinement by proposing improvements, such as exploring alternative scaling methods, dimensionality reduction with 
      PCA, and feature creation.

•     Data Interpretation and Reporting: Emphasized the importance of model interpretability, contributing to the project's overall success through the exploration of feature 
      importance and meaningful insights.
