# Data Analysis Portfolio
This is a portfolio consisting of numerous projects coded in python, SQL and R.

### EDA Indices
I extracted historical prices on two indices in this project - US30 and NAS100. 
After extraction, I transformed the data in order to obtain certain statistics and plot the relevant graphs.
All this was done to provide answers to the questions seen in the notebook.
